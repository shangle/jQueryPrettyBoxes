jQuery Pretty Boxes
=====================

I'm attempting to shamelessly rip off the look found here: http://blog.instagram.com/post/23457283986/solar-eclipse

Goals of this Project
-----------------------

My ultimate goal is to make a great plugin, but these are the real reason I'm working on this project:

1. Learn to create a jQuery Plugin
2. Maintain code through github
3. Achieve a rudimentary automatic system that will place photos
4. Allow options and extendability
5. Find if this can help the community

Documentation
--------------

This is coming soon. I have to write the plugin first.
